A Dungeon crawl game built with Phaser.
Connects to an API that holds score data for the game.
Scores are updated for each user.

Each time a level is complete the score will be checked against both the user's past scores, as well as a ranking for each level and where they will be ranked against all other users.

Implements a user login system to store past attempts and scores, as well as maintain game state for return visits.
